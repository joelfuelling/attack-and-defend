This is React challenge 1 (end of Part 1) of Jonas Schmedtmanns Complete-React-Tutorial Udemy class https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/.

# Go apply what you've learned!

- This is an exercise to go and use what we've learned thus far in the React udemy class to create our own small app with multiple states, components, and handler functions. 

- I'm going to make 'Attack and Defend', a simple user vs enemy attatck, defend, (possible elements: fire, water, etc.), math based calculator. Components will be:

App:
Player -> EditPlayerForm                 
Enemy -> EnemyList -> AddEnemyForm
Button
Outcome
